  "zebra": {
    "description": "Zebras possess a distinctive appearance characterized by their barrel-chested bodies and elongated faces. Their long necks are adorned with long, erect manes that stand upright, contributing to their striking silhouette. The body is supported by thin legs, each ending in a spade-shaped toe that is encased in a hard hoof, providing stability and strength. The tail is tufted, adding to their unique profile. Zebras have large, prominent eyes positioned on the sides of their heads, allowing for a wide field of vision, which is particularly advantageous when grazing in tall grass. Their moderately long, erect ears are highly mobile, enabling them to detect sounds from various directions. The front legs are notably longer than the back legs, a feature that distinguishes them from other equines. On their front legs, zebras exhibit chestnut callosities, which are absent in horses. The skull of a zebra is relatively small with a straight dorsal outline, featuring protruding eye sockets and a narrower rostrum. The dental structure includes large incisors for clipping grass and rough molars and premolars for grinding, with males possessing spade-shaped canines that can serve as weapons. The overall appearance of zebras is further defined by their unique coloration, which consists of bold black and white stripes that vary in pattern among individuals.",

  "hyenaspotted": {
    "description": "The spotted hyena has a robust and muscular body, characterized by a strong and well-developed neck and forequarters, which contribute to its powerful appearance. The hindquarters are relatively underdeveloped, giving the animal a distinctive rounded rump that is less angular, aiding in evasion from attackers. The head is wide and flat, featuring a blunt muzzle that is broad at the base, complemented by a broad rhinarium that enhances its sense of smell. Unlike the pointed ears of the striped hyena, the spotted hyena has rounded ears that are set high on the head, providing a keen sense of hearing. Each foot is equipped with four digits, which are webbed and end in short, stout, and blunt claws, ideal for traction and digging. The paw-pads are broad and flat, with the undersurface of the foot being naked, allowing for better grip on various terrains. The tail is relatively short and resembles a pompom, adding to the hyena's unique silhouette. The female spotted hyena is noticeably larger than the male, a rare trait among mammals. The skull is notably large with a narrower sagittal crest, housing powerful jaws that are equipped with specialized teeth; the upper and lower third premolars are conical and designed for crushing bone, while the carnassials are positioned behind these bone-crushing teeth, allowing for efficient processing of food. The overall appearance of the spotted hyena is one of strength and adaptability, with features that are well-suited for its scavenging and hunting lifestyle.",

    "description": "The warthog has a distinctive appearance characterized by its largely bare body and head, which are covered in bristly hairs that give it a rugged texture. The back features a prominent crest of hair that runs along the spine, while the face is adorned with noticeable tufts of hair, particularly around the cheeks and chin. The most striking features of the warthog are its facial wattles, which are especially pronounced in males, giving them a unique and rugged look. Males also possess very prominent tusks that curve outward from the mouth, creating a formidable appearance; these tusks are significantly larger than those of females, which have smaller tusks. The overall body shape is robust, with a relatively large head that is set on a thick neck, leading to a sturdy torso. The legs are short and strong, supporting the animal's weight and allowing it to forage effectively. The tail is relatively short and ends in a tuft of hair, which is another distinguishing feature.

    "description": "The impala is a medium-sized, slender-bodied antelope characterized by its graceful appearance. The coat is glossy and exhibits a striking two-tone coloration, with a reddish-brown back that transitions to tan flanks, sharply contrasting with a white underbelly. The head features prominent facial characteristics, including white rings encircling the eyes, complemented by a light-colored chin and snout. The ears are elongated and tipped with black, adding to the animal's expressive features. Males are distinguished by their slender, lyre-shaped horns, which are ridged and diverge outward, showcasing a circular cross-section and a hollow base. The horns are elegantly arched, allowing for interlocking during confrontations. The hindquarters display black streaks that extend from the buttocks to the upper hindlegs, while the bushy tail is adorned with a solid black stripe running along the midline. The tail is notably bushy and contributes to the overall aesthetic of the impala. Additionally, the hindlegs possess scent glands covered by a tuft of black hair, which are visually distinctive. The impala's overall coloration and body structure bear resemblance to the gerenuk, although it is differentiated by the absence of black thigh stripes. The black-faced impala subspecies is larger and darker, featuring a dark stripe on either side of the nose that ascends toward the eyes, thinning as it approaches the forehead, along with a larger black tip on the ears and a bushier tail.

    "description": "Elephants are characterized by their massive size and distinctive features. Their heads are large and robust, with a prominent cranium that supports strong muscles for tusk usage and fighting. The skull has a honeycomb-like appearance due to air cavities that reduce weight while maintaining strength. The trunk is a highly versatile and elongated appendage, featuring a prehensile tip that is capable of grasping objects, and it is covered in a wrinkled, thick skin that appears grayish. The ears are large and fan-like, shaped somewhat like a continent, and they help regulate body temperature; they are also covered in a rough texture. The eyes are relatively small and set deep within the head, surrounded by thick eyelids and long eyelashes that protect them from debris. The tusks, which are elongated incisors, can be curved and are often visible protruding from the mouth, with a smooth, ivory-like surface. The body is massive and barrel-shaped, supported by thick, pillar-like legs that end in broad, flat feet with toenails rather than hooves. The skin is thick and wrinkled, appearing gray and often covered in mud or dust, which helps with temperature regulation and protection from parasites.

  "giraffe": {
    "description": "The giraffe is a strikingly tall and unique animal characterized by its long neck and legs, which contribute to its overall height. Its body is relatively short compared to its limbs, giving it a distinctive silhouette. The skin of the giraffe is primarily gray or tan, with a notable thickness that provides durability. The coat is adorned with large, irregular dark blotches or patches that can vary in color from orange to chestnut, brown, or nearly black, all surrounded by lighter hair that is typically white or cream. This unique coat pattern is not only visually striking but also serves a functional purpose, aiding in camouflage within the dappled light of savannah woodlands. Each giraffe possesses a unique coat pattern, making them easily identifiable. The tail is long and ends in a dark tuft of hair, which is used to swat away insects. The skin beneath the blotches is thought to play a role in thermoregulation, featuring complex blood vessel systems and large sweat glands. The fur may also contain chemical defenses, with certain aromatic compounds contributing to a characteristic scent, which is more pronounced in males.

Its skin is thick and largely hairless, presenting a purplish-grey or blue-black coloration on the back and sides, while the underside, including areas around the eyes and ears, is a lighter brownish-pink. The head is large and features an hourglass-shaped skull with a long snout, housing small eyes, ears, and nostrils that are positioned high on the skull to remain above water when the body is submerged. The eyes are protected by nictitating membranes, which can cover them when the hippo is underwater.
