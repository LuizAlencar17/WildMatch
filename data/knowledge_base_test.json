  "zebra": {
    "description": "Zebras possess a distinctive appearance characterized by their barrel-chested bodies and elongated faces. Their long necks are adorned with long, erect manes that stand upright, contributing to their striking silhouette. The body is supported by thin legs, each ending in a spade-shaped toe that is protected by a hard hoof, providing stability and strength. The tail is tufted, adding to their unique profile. Zebras have large, prominent incisors that are adapted for grazing, allowing them to clip grass blades effectively, while their rough molars and premolars are designed for grinding vegetation. Males feature spade-shaped canines, which are visibly larger and can serve as weapons during fights. The eyes are positioned on the sides of the head and are set high, enabling zebras to survey their surroundings, particularly useful for spotting predators while feeding in tall grass. Their moderately long, erect ears are highly mobile, allowing them to detect sounds from various directions. Notably, zebras exhibit chestnut callosities on their front legs, a feature that distinguishes them from other equines. Their front legs are longer than their back legs, contributing to their unique gait and movement. The skull of a zebra is relatively small with a straight dorsal outline, featuring protruding eye sockets and a narrower rostrum, which are key diagnostic traits. The postorbital bar is less conspicuous, and the dental structure includes a V-shaped canal separating the metaconid and metastylid of the tooth, along with rounded enamel walls, all of which are visible in their skeletal structure.",

    "raw_summary": "Zebras (US: , UK: ) (subgenus Hippotigris) are African equines with distinctive black-and-white striped coats. There are three living species: Grévy's zebra (Equus grevyi), the plains zebra (E. quagga), and the mountain zebra (E. zebra). Zebras share the genus Equus with horses and asses, the three groups being the only living members of the family Equidae. Zebra stripes come in different patterns, unique to each individual. Several theories have been proposed for the function of these patterns,..."

  "elephant": {
    "description": "Elephants are characterized by their massive size and distinctive features. Their heads are large and robust, with a prominent cranium that supports strong muscles for tusk usage and fighting. The skull has a honeycomb-like appearance due to air cavities that reduce weight while maintaining strength. The trunk is a remarkable elongated structure, highly flexible and muscular, extending from the face and equipped with a prehensile tip that can grasp objects. The trunk is covered in wrinkled skin, which aids in its dexterity. Elephants possess large, fan-like ears that are thin and covered in coarse hair, which help regulate body temperature. The ears are shaped like a large, rounded fan and can be quite expressive. Their eyes are relatively small compared to their head, set deep within the skull, and surrounded by thick skin. The mouth is large, with a wide, flat upper lip that aids in grasping vegetation. The lower jaw is dense and strong, designed to support the grinding of tough plant material. Elephants have two large, curved tusks that protrude from the upper jaw, made of ivory and used for digging, foraging, and defense. Their bodies are covered in thick, wrinkled skin that appears grayish and is often marked with patches of mud or dust, which help with temperature regulation and protection from parasites. The legs are sturdy and pillar-like, supporting their immense weight, with large, rounded feet that have thick pads for stability and cushioning. The tail is relatively short and thin, ending in a tuft of coarse hair. Overall, the elephant's appearance is a combination of strength and grace, with each body part adapted for its lifestyle as a herbivore.",

  "giraffe": {
    "description": "The giraffe is a strikingly tall and unique animal characterized by its long neck and legs, which give it an imposing stature. Its body is relatively short compared to its height, creating a distinctive silhouette. The skin of the giraffe is primarily gray or tan, with a notable thickness that contributes to its robust appearance. The coat is adorned with large, irregular dark blotches or patches that can vary in color from orange to chestnut, brown, or nearly black, all surrounded by lighter hair that is typically white or cream. This unique coat pattern is not only visually striking but also serves a functional purpose, providing some level of camouflage among the dappled light of savannah woodlands. Each giraffe possesses a unique coat pattern, making them easily identifiable. The tail is long and ends in a tuft of dark hair, which is used to swat away insects. The skin beneath the blotches is thought to play a role in thermoregulation, featuring complex blood vessel systems and large sweat glands. Overall, the giraffe's appearance is a remarkable blend of elegance and functionality, with its distinctive coloration and patterns contributing to its survival in the wild.",

  "lion": {
    "description": "The lion is a robust and muscular feline with a broad chest and a short, rounded head that features a slightly flattened frontal region. Its ears are round and relatively small, positioned on the sides of the head. Male lions exhibit a broader head compared to females. The fur of the lion varies in color, ranging from light buff to silvery grey, yellowish red, and dark brown, with the underparts generally being lighter in shade. New-born lions are adorned with dark spots that gradually fade as they mature, although faint remnants of these spots may persist on the legs and underparts into adulthood. The lion's tail is distinctive, ending in a dark, hairy tuft that may conceal a small, hard spine or spur, which is not present at birth but develops around six months of age and becomes prominent by seven months. The lion's skull shares similarities with that of the tiger, characterized by broader nasal openings and a shorter postorbital region. The lower jaw structure is a key feature for species identification. Overall, the lion's appearance is marked by its powerful build, varied fur coloration, and distinctive tail tuft, all contributing to its majestic presence in the animal kingdom.",

  "leopard": {
    "description": "The leopard is a strikingly beautiful animal characterized by its soft and thick fur, which is notably softer on the belly compared to the back. The fur color varies among individuals, ranging from pale yellowish to dark golden, adorned with dark spots that are grouped in distinctive rosettes. The underbelly is a clean white, providing a stark contrast to the vibrant fur above. The tail is relatively short and features a white tip, with a white underside and spots that form incomplete bands toward the end. The pupils of the leopard are round, adding to its expressive face. In terms of coloration, leopards from arid regions exhibit a pale cream to yellowish or ochraceous hue, while those inhabiting forests and mountainous areas are much darker, displaying a deep golden tone. The rosettes on the fur are unique to each individual, with circular patterns found in East African populations, squarish shapes in Southern Africa, and larger rosettes in Asian leopards. The fur's texture varies, with shorter guard hairs on the face and head, gradually increasing in length toward the flanks and belly. In colder climates, the fur tends to be grayish and longer, while juveniles have a woolly appearance that makes them look dark due to densely arranged spots. The leopard's distinctive rosettes are different from those of the jaguar, which have darker centers and smaller spots. Additionally, some leopards may exhibit melanism, resulting in a black coat, while others may show erythrism, leading to lighter or pinkish fur, known as \"strawberry leopards.\"",
